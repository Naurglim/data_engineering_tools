In the video, we discussed that .iterrows() returns each DataFrame row as a tuple of (index, pandas Series) pairs. 
But, what does this mean? Let's explore with a few coding exercises.
A pandas DataFrame has been loaded into your session called pit_df. 
This DataFrame contains the stats for the Major League Baseball team named the Pittsburgh Pirates (abbreviated as 'PIT') from the year 2008 to the year 2012.

You've been hired by the San Francisco Giants as an analystâ€”congrats! 
The team's owner wants you to calculate a metric called the run differential for each season from the year 2008 to 2012. 
This metric is calculated by subtracting the total number of runs a team allowed in a season from the team's total number of runs scored in a season. 
'RS' means runs scored and 'RA' means runs allowed.
