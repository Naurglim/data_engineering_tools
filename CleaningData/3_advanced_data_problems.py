banking = get_dataset('banking', '1')


## 1: Uniform currencies
# Find values of acct_cur that are equal to 'euro'
acct_eu = banking['acct_cur'] == 'euro'

# Convert acct_amount where it is in euro to dollars
banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_amount'] = banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_amount'] * 1.1

# Unify acct_cur column by changing 'euro' values to 'dollar'
banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_cur'] = 'dollar'

# Assert that only dollar currency remains
assert banking['acct_cur'].unique() == 'dollar'


## 2: Uniform dates
# Print the header of account_opend
print(banking['account_opened'].head())

# Convert account_opened to datetime
banking['account_opened'] = pd.to_datetime(banking['account_opened'],
                                           # Infer datetime format

# Get year of account opened
banking['acct_year'] = banking['account_opened'].dt.strftime('%Y')

# Print acct_year
print(banking['acct_year'])


## 3: Data integrity:
banking = get_dataset('banking', '2')

# Store fund columns to sum against
fund_columns = ['fund_A', 'fund_B', 'fund_C', 'fund_D']

# Find rows where fund_columns row sum == inv_amount
inv_equ = banking[fund_columns].sum(axis=1) == banking['inv_amount']

# Store consistent and inconsistent data
consistent_inv = banking[inv_equ]
inconsistent_inv = banking[~inv_equ]

# Store consistent and inconsistent data
print("Number of inconsistent investments: ", inconsistent_inv.shape[0])


## 4: 
banking = get_dataset('banking','3')

# Print number of missing values in banking
print(banking.isna().sum())

# Visualize missingness matrix
msno.matrix(banking)
plt.show()

# Isolate missing and non missing values of inv_amount
missing_investors = banking[banking['inv_amount'].isna()]
investors = banking[~banking['inv_amount'].isna()]

# Sort banking by age and visualize
banking_sorted = banking.sort_values(by = 'age')
msno.matrix(banking_sorted)
plt.show()


## 5: 
# In this exercise, you're working with another version of the banking DataFrame 
# that contains missing values for both the cust_id column and the acct_amount 
# column.
banking = get_dataset('banking','4')

# Drop missing values of cust_id
banking_fullid = banking.dropna(subset = ['cust_id'])

# Compute estimated acct_amount
acct_imp = banking_fullid['inv_amount'] * 5 

# Impute missing acct_amount with corresponding acct_imp
banking_imputed = banking_fullid.fillna({'acct_amount':acct_imp})

# Print number of missing values
print(banking_imputed.isna().sum())
